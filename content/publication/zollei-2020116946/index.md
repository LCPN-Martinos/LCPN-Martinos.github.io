abstract: 'The development of automated tools for brain morphometric analysis in infants
  has lagged significantly behind analogous tools for adults. This gap reflects the
  greater challenges in this domain due to: 1) a smaller-scaled region of interest,
  2) increased motion corruption, 3) regional changes in geometry due to heterochronous
  growth, and 4) regional variations in contrast properties corresponding to ongoing
  myelination and other maturation processes. Nevertheless, there is a great need
  for automated image-processing tools to quantify differences between infant groups
  and other individuals, because aberrant cortical morphologic measurements (including
  volume, thickness, surface area, and curvature) have been associated with neuropsychiatric,
  neurologic, and developmental disorders in children. In this paper we present an
  automated segmentation and surface extraction pipeline designed to accommodate clinical
  MRI studies of infant brains in a population 0-2 year-olds. The algorithm relies
  on a single channel of T1-weighted MR images to achieve automated segmentation of
  cortical and subcortical brain areas, producing volumes of subcortical structures
  and surface models of the cerebral cortex. We evaluated the algorithm both qualitatively
  and quantitatively using manually labeled datasets, relevant comparator software
  solutions cited in the literature, and expert evaluations. The computational tools
  and atlases described in this paper will be distributed to the research community
  as part of the FreeSurfer image analysis package.'
