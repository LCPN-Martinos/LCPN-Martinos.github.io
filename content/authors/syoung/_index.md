Sala acquires and analyzes high-resolution ex vivo structural and diffusion MRI data from infant postmortem subjects. The data are used for manual white matter tractography (TrackVis), whole-brain segmentation of cortical and subcortical structures (FreeSurfer), and as inputs for training deep learning models.
