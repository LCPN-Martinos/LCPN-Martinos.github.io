Nathan has many different functions in his role as a research assistant at the LCPN. He helps to organize proper paperwork and documents as well as integrating 3rd party brain processing tools into the LCPN computer cluster. These tools are mostly for in-vivo brain samples, and he also helps troubleshoot local ex-vivo processing tools.
 
In the wet lab, Nathan is trained to properly store and prepare brain samples for MRI scanning. He is certified to scan brains in 3T and 7T scanners and the types of scans that Nathan processes are mostly infant/fetal. These scans consist of diffusion as well as structural scans which are useful to visualize the white matter tracts in the brainstem and cortical regions of the brain. Processing on these scans are currently being used in an Ontogeny project that summarizes the connectivity of brain regions across age groups.
